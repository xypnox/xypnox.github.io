# Theme manager/Editor/Designer

(Name To Be Determined)

The above widget allows you to choose between multiple themes (styles) and modes (dark/light).

You can customize themes on the variables:

- [Colors](#colors)
- [Typography](#typography)
- [Layout](#layout)

Changes are auto-saved and persisted via localstorage, so browsing other pages will not reset the theme.

Creating a new theme forks the currently applied theme and sets a randomized two word name. Change the name if you want.

For inspiration browse the [Theme Showcase](#theme-showcase).


## Colors

There are currently five axis to adjust the color:

- <span class="color_swatch" style="--color: var(--primary-color)" /> _Primary_ 
  Similar to brand color, and is the most prominent color on the screen. 
- <span class="color_swatch" style="--color: var(--secondary-color)" /> _Secondary_ 
  Compliments primary color, for now only shades the gradient
- <span class="color_swatch" style="--color: var(--surface)" /> _Surface_ 
  The color of the surface of the cards
  Tip: Bit of transparency helps in modals/poups blur
- <span class="color_swatch" style="--color: var(--background)" />_Background_ 
  The background of the page
- <span class="color_swatch" style="--color: var(--text)" /> _Text_ 
  The color of the text


The rest of the colors, such as: border, shadow, color over primary, heading color, tertiary text color etc are generated from these fundamental five. Play around to see how each of these affects the rest of the colors.

## Typography

- _Font family_
  Change the family of the fonts
  
All fonts from Google Fonts, and your local system fonts are supported.

Recommended fonts are also shown. These recommendations are chosen for clarity and to depict various variations.

You can browse all fonts at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

> Note: Please use Title case or the exact example of the name Google Fonts suggests.


## Layout

- _Border Radius_
  Change the base border radius
  The border radius are applied in 0.5x 1x 1.5x 2x increments.
  Setting to 0 removes all border-radii, squaring the corners.

## Default Themes

- Aster
- Brutalist
