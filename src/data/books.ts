It also covers the topics of labeling any worker revolting for higher wages as \"Reds\"/communists. And the efforts of the status quo to repel and extinguish any uncertainty and disturbance amongst the lowest classes.",

    "My Review": "<b>3.5/5</b><br/><br/>Tries to answer a few deep questions such as: <br/><br/><i>If an ignorant person is happy, is it wrong to douse them out of their beloved ignorance?</i><br/><br/><i>What is it in a good content that makes it worthwhile? There is a certain similarity between good books and good movies, in songs that make you think that stop you and make you question the day to day life. What is that thing?</i><br/><br/><i>What is left when someone dies? How does someone leave behind any sign that they were alive on this wonderful chaotic universe?</i><br/><br/>The book tries to answer some of these and some answers fall short. Sometimes it is represented as a feeling of what should happen but not why.<br/><br/>A nice piece of fiction to use as a vantage point to look towards the bleak future rushing towards us faster and faster everyday.<br/><br/>On the writing style, the author has used too many comparisons and literary devices everywhere. It is too full of colorful and shiny words. And too much of whiteness makes nothing white and everything plain. Some of the brilliance should have been reserved for the crucial parts of the plot, but neigh, it is used and sometimes abused in every paragraph; Making it a little tiring.<br/><br/>",

The rest is just a setup for the last monologue of the protagonist.",

They cover mostly politics and society, and often put light on issues that are invisible to our eyes. And the saddest part of these funny satires is that they were written some 50 to 60 years ago and still apply to this very day.",

    "My Review": "Oh it's good to be with Fitz again. <br/><br/>After years of happily living at Withywoods, Fitz finds himself drawn to the very things he escaped years ago, He tries and tries again to be the right father, husband and friend with varying levels of success. As is usual with Hobb, the character development is breathtaking. We get a clear understanding of what the protagonist(s) thinks and the reason why the decisions are taken. <br/><br/>And as usual the book is filled with great examples of human psychology just like the rest of the works by Hobb.<br/><br/>You do need to read the previous books on Fitz and the Fool to understand some of the story elements and why some characters behave as they do.<br/><br/>Without revealing any spoilers, I would only say that this is a wonderful read filled with ample twist and turns and sets up the premise for the rest of the books to follow. I just can't wait enough to start the next book in the trilogy!",

    "My Review": "I read this book not to improve my non fiction writing in particular, rather to improve the language in general. Hence, I only read the first part of the book that did not particularly address the non-fic genre.<br/><br/>The first part is quite good. It contains solid advice and tips on improving the written English in all mediums of communication. The most important thing that I remember from the book is that \"Rewriting is writing\". That is, if your first draft is the final version then it is crap, to improve the language, it is necessary to edit re-edit and in essence rewriting is the essence of writing.",

And this book was not for me too.<br/><br/>After a few pages in, you will realise that you are in a shithole, but since a hundred people online have rated this book 5 stars, you wonder, perhaps there may be something good in the later pages. BIG MISTAKE. This book goes from being unbelievable, to being twisted, dark, non nonsensical, to where is the author and why hasn't he been nuked by UN already. <br/><br/>Perhaps, those who feel while reading would like it. I don't.<br/><br/>Save time, read something else, anything else.",

Earlier it was easier for me to say that I was wasting a lot of time. But, It was hard for me not to.<br/><br/>Now, after understanding the importance and the process behind deep work, I can confidently say that I have started saving time and doing significantly more valuable work than before.<br/><br/>This book has, literally, changed my life. <br/>",
