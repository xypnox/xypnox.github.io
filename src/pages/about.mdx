## What is a website

This is a website.

A place on the internet.

Where the ideas of mine are granted space to flourish.

There is music for you to enjoy, courtesy of [MYAUDIOVISION](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3tdB2cNPY1qeyk7jdnV0Fm?si=pKI2oKccQOCfHQUw_9FTnQ) - [Coverless Book (Lofi)](https://pixabay.com/music/beats-coverless-book-lofi-186307/)

## Best viewed with

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- [Linux](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-distributions/) Or any other open operating system.


## How was it built

Using a lot of code. That can be found at [github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io).

This website uses:

1. [Astro](https://astro.build)
1. [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com)
1. [Iconify Icons](https://iconify.design/)
   1. [Phosphor Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/ph/)
1. [Themescura](/blag/posts/themescura/introducing-themescura/)

## Components

There are several components that I have recreated or invented anew.

Some can be found in this [sample blog post](/blag/posts/sample-blog/).

Some can be found in the [warehouse](/warehouse/).

## Content

I don't use large language models to write any of the content on this website. 

Neither do I allow anyone to use the text from this website to be used for training a Large language or AI model.
