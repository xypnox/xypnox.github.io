So long since I [last covered](/blag/posts/migrating-to-zola/) how this website was made.

A lot has changed. The underlying generator changed from [Zola](https://getzola.org) to [Astro](https://astro.build). And though I did not incorporate any [React](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/) in the previous blog, I have switched to [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and use it for client-side interactivity. With Astro I could combine both the landing page and the [Blag](/blag/) into one single website and codebase. 

Here are a few recent changes made to this website, and the thoughts behind them.

## [Projects](/projects/) and [Design](/design/) Pages

I wanted to make a portfolio of my Design and Frontend creations.

Usually, design portfolios are hosted on Behance and similar services, where the entire page of a project is plastered from top to bottom with full width images. All the screenshots and description about the project is included inside these images. These are very hard to get right, considering the responsiveness and fluidity of layout. The platforms offload all the work to the designer. For every single project. 

The [Project](/projects/) pages afford me control over both the raw data and the layout of the page. The structure (separation of description from image) allows me to keep the project details accessible and readable regardless of the size of images or the device width. Otherwise, the project details littered inside the images would have to be very large to remain readable on a small screen.

It took a while to curate the screenshots and prototypes, especially the [older](/project/finbox/) [ones](/project/grameen-setu/). I have added additional commentary and details in each image's description.

### Image Gallery and Slider


I could not find a decent slider library or component with theme-able styles so I had to write [one from scratch](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/components/imageSlider.tsx). It has niceties such as keybindings and thumbnails. 

The Image Slider is used in two kinds of galleries, [One in the project pages](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/components/projectImages.tsx) which shows images one after another with their description, and [the other](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/components/imageGrid.tsx) which shows a grid of images.

Moreover, the image description component of the slider is customizable. For [Covers](/design/covers/) the component in slider is the link to the playlist. You can open the playlist of a cover by clicking the "Play" in the Slider.

The [code](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/components/projectImages.tsx#L52-L63) to use the Slider isn't [too complex](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/components/projectImages.tsx#L67-L93) [either](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/components/imageGrid.tsx#L334-L338). 

I will add zooming and panning later on.

### Types and Checks

I have structured the content of Projects inside [typescript files](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/a4128fdcdb2b21f3a30456f6db65e8ca347f9491/src/content/projects/notes.ts). This allows me to write the content of project pages in a clean, minimal, and type-safe way.

I was fluctuating between using markdown, json, and typescript. And even though typescript feels overkill to write content, it has decent structure, with the linter & language server providing helpful errors and suggestions when I edit the content.

There are [additional checks](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/utils/images.ts#L4-L23) to ensure that the images actually exists in directory before being used in the pages.


### Images CDN

If you took a glance at the [Projects](/projects/) pages, you would have appreciated the high quality of the images and screenshots.

Unfortunately, the raw size of images in the projects pages is currently ~130MB. I surely could not store all of them in the repository. I already have a few images with the blog posts bloating it.

I have stored the images for Projects and Covers in `src/assets/`, which is added to `.gitignore`. It is synced with the Bucket/CDN with [simple](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/buildScripts/fetchImagesCdn.ts) [scripts](https://github.com/xypnox/xypnox.github.io/blob/5b4857f11cf230af191690a788eb3ef7b8bd9b02/src/buildScripts/uploadImages.ts). The assets are fetched at build time in the GitHub Action. Astro optimizes the images and therefore the final size of images in the build is so small.

I will later move raw images for future blog posts to CDN as well.

## [Tools](/tools/)

These are small pieces of software that do a small thing. I make them because I can't find any decent ones.

I created a few tools on [xypnox.studio](https://xypnox.studio/) where I experiment with SolidJS and have now added more [Tools here](/tools/).

### [NamemaN](/tools/nameman/)

import Nameman from "../../../tools/nameman/nman.astro";

<Nameman />

<p />
 
A common problem faced by many entrepreneurs is to find a decent name for the official registration of an organization. I saw LLMs being employed for inspiration, which could write fluently, but are only able to provide a handful of suggestions before tumbling over themselves.

NamemaN takes a list of most popular English words, then slices, dices, and joins them together to form interesting (sometimes meaningful) names. The advantage is the speed and volume of suggestions. One can very rapidly iterate through a lot of decent-to-good suggestions.

Moreover, if the names are favorited by either clicking the star or the name itself, they can then be exported as text/list.

It has been used to register 1 Org successfully (of those that are known to me).

### [EnHigh](/tools/enhigh/)

import { EnHigh } from "../../../tools/enhigh";

<EnHigh defaultText={"This here is EnHigh. It highlights english language and sentences and stuff.\nI made it to experiment with language and text highlighting."} client:only />

<p />

I made [EnHigh](/tools/enhigh/) to experiment with a [part-of-speech tagging library](https://github.com/finnlp/en-pos) in javascript. The library didn't work that well (with technical prose), however, the attempt also generated the sentence and paragraph highlighters which do create some decent variations.

### [JSee](/tools/jsee/)

JSee is a json viewer with a little bit of added nicety. It has nested objects, types, and error display. I have used it for JSON from sources that don't have a linter or are unformatted.

> *Note*: Unfortunately, the embed of JSee seems a bit too much for Chrome (works fine in Firefox (the recommended browser)). But to save the normies still using chrome, I have omitted the embed here.
>
> [Use JSee on its page](/tools/jsee/)

## Themescura

Due to the wonder of [themescura](/blag/posts/themescura/introducing-themescura/), every page on this website sans the [poems](/poems/) are customizable. This includes the new [Projects](/projects/), [Design](/design/), [Tools](/tools/) etc.

## Music

There is music here now, for a bit of ambiance on all the pages.

I took a nice lofi track called [Coverless Book (Lofi)](https://pixabay.com/music/beats-coverless-book-lofi-186307/) by [MYAUDIOVISION](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3tdB2cNPY1qeyk7jdnV0Fm?si=pKI2oKccQOCfHQUw_9FTnQ). And split it into two, first an intro segment and a repeating section. The music is played at half volume.

Now that I have the basic pipelines setup, I can add high quality images and designs that I created over the years and for which I could not find a decent home. (Fediverse/post style sharing is terrible for browsing. Xshitter/insta style sharing is terrible in general.)

Expect to see more, including a home for that cover wallpaper of this post...
