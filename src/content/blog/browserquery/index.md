I didn't end up with (over) 4000 tabs out of nowhere. No one is born with so many tabs. You have to open them, by yourself, one by one. I started with only a couple of tabs, just like everyone else. 

I use a few extensions in the browser, Firefox. Tree Style Tabs. It does two nice things. First it shows opened tabs in a left sidebar in a nested tree. Tabs opened from a parent are nested inside them. (infinitely). 

And secondly, every time my browser restarts starts, the extension restores the previous session, but doesn't actually load any tabs unless they are opened (or pinned).

Then I have 7 windows of Firefox open. I didn't start with seven windows either. I had one window to begin with but with split monitors I wanted one window to just have the localhost development tabs to 
Two of them are ancient but have not been touched in a while. Apart from them, there is one with mail, mastodon (elk) etc pinned, then there is a bookmarked (to read) collection with hn.algolia.com pinned. There is also a general dev window, dev windows for two clients, a window with design and a window with notes and localhost tabs.

I also use two 1440p monitors (at native res).

So. I have a lot of tabs.

To the point where I need to start closing because anymore doesn't make sense.

And how do I even find the tabs to close? A few windows have over a thousand tabs. A milliwindow XD.

So I made a companion extension to find or close tabs. It is therefore called browserquery.
Maybe there aren't many extensions like this or maybe I have been spoiled to only use what I code.

The extension itself allows searching for text in the url and the title of opened tabs. The searched results can be grouped by duplicates, domain, window, active etc.

I have successfully used this extension to curb the current overdose of opened tabs galore.

It works pretty fast much thanks to SolidJS, It was pretty easy to write and package thanks to WXT.

I have not included any themability because I am the only regular user of the extension. (So it is theoretically still customizable for its user. XD) 

If you use this and want to have customizability reach out to me.





And,

I almost forgot to write this post.
