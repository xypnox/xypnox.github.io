I got onboard the fedi train via mastodon about 3 years ago. I have used mastodon now and then, while frequently returning to twitter. But during these years my experience with mastodon has been far better than with twitter, and it has been more enlightening.

Twitter. Or whatever it is now.

I remember myself being addicted to it.

There is a kick, in watching the detriment of others, especially the ones you consider bad in your own mental compass. (You have a compass right? Right?). There is a fear, in missing out on something. There is an urgency, to shower thoughts upon others. There is an image, inside of everyone of everyone, and a responsibility to keep it held high. There is a desire, to have the last word, whatever it may be. There is an economic force, forcing everyone to sell something, in every third thing they say. There was, more or less, what there usually is on an algorithmic platform incentivising its paid users to post "engaging" content. Did I miss the eagerness to proclaim, the resonating echoes in the chamber, the bot farms, the crypto scams, the paywalls and payolas.

So many; to get you addicted.
