You can try out themescura from the popup at the bottom right corner, or visit the [customize](/customize) page of this website for the [Guide](/customize#guide) and [Showcase](/customize#theme-showcase).

Before reading the post, try to customize the look so that it matches your tastes. Remember, this post is only as beautiful as you can make it.

# What it does

Themescura takes a palette of initial variables and generates a set of CSS variables, it also generates artifacts, types/completion, that can be used to develop the frontend. You can edit the palette in real time, and the theme palettes and generated variables are stored in localstorage so that theme can be applied without loading the editor and can be edited whenever needed.

# Where can it be used

- To experiment with fonts/colors
- At the development stage to define/edit the theme
- At the production stage to allow the user to change the app's theme
  - At all axis
  - With some limited options

# Motivation

With a single style you can only make a website look one way.

Humans are not uni-themed.

There is no perfect theme.

Customization has been hard ever since. Could making it easier/more accessible change the way frontend and software is perceived?

For a sense of control.

Every website should be customizable.

The problems with current customization.

A person who:
- Doesn't know the details of color theory
- Doesn't know the details of typography
- But can still determine by looking at something whether the font/colors make sense



# How it works

Where AI

Unfortunately, to the disappointment of several, there is no AI underneath.
