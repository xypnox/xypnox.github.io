We have all been through this. You open almost any government application, website or software and you know you will enjoy your time using it. They are just so good, nicely developed, modern, blazing fast robust examples of how software that is meant for the public at large should be made.

If you couldn't guess that that was pure sarcasm, either you haven't encountered government software yet or you are someone who develops the government software. For the first person, I envy you. For the second, I hate you.

I'll start by taking an example. The website of my institute that is used to generate CVs for resumes has several mandatory select fields with a single option. If you know that a user has _only one_ thing to select from, and they _have to select it_, then why in the entire world would you not set it automatically to that value?

I can forgive poor looks, I can even forgive misalignment, performance and almost everything else, but the complete lack of thought given in the development of government software makes me furious.

But I don't need to ramble on forever on how bad the government software is. We all know it is bad. But there is an interesting question to explore, why is government software bad?

There are myriad of reasons that can explain this total failure of software as a whole. Lack of care, corruption, lack of know-how and bureaucratic management are some for starters. But the most important reason why, is because government software _can_ never _fail_.

Which obviously seems ridiculous because it is of course a total failure in itself. But by failure here I mean that there is no other alternative to government software. It is the only thing that you can use, and therefore you have to use it. However unpleasant and annoying the whole process would be, you have to use it. You have to use it as long as it doesn't fail spectacularly, and even if it does, as is the case with websites that release results of various government examinations, you have to use it.

In contrast, a company who develops software as a product for profit has to care for the customer. They can't excuse bad design because they will always have competitors. The very nature of software makes it easy for others to replicate an idea and make a competing product easily. What really differentiates the successful from the failures usually boils down to customer satisfaction. And that depends highly on a good thoughtful design.

The simple lack of alternatives makes it very easy for the government to be stuck with crappy software. Because you can't go anywhere else.

There are fields where this no longer applies, for example if you want to reserve a train, nowadays you don't have to explicitly rely only on IRCTC (but if you want guarantee and base prices you have to).

If there ever was an analogy to government software, it would be a stinking lonely toilet in a busy place. You hate to use it but you have no other option, and it is precisely why the owner of the toilet hasn't put any serious efforts in improving it.
