We, the young adults,  
not knowing a thing about life  
but still trying to know what it is  
what it all means.

We use words like love, success, satisfaction  
words we don't understand  
to make sense  
of something  
we have never experienced.

Then are all our efforts useless?  
Is thinking about an unfaced problem wrong?  
Or just wondering what life is, without living, right?  
We spend too much time wondering,  
without even questioning our place to wonder.

Our thoughts change in a second a minute a year  
and we know we will change too  
Knowing things doesn't make things familiar  
For we all know death  
But we don't know death.
