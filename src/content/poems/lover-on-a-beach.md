The lover stood on the beach  
Getting to know the feel of it  
The calm waves  
The cool breeze  
The gentle water  
dripping wet his feet  
He was delighted  
On the beach  
For the beach was a way to the ocean  
Ocean of love

The lover swam  
Swam in the sea of love  
In the ocean  
With no effort he was dragged in  
And the weightlessness  
Made him feel free  
He was free at last  
And it was awesome  
To be in love

Slowly however  
He started to tire,  
Water reached his chin,  
And then his nose was submerged  
Before he knew it  
He was underwater  
Falling, to hit the bottom  
Failing, to take a breath  
Love has its own games

And the fall was endless  
The tension increased  
Every foot that he dropped  
Becoming unbearable  
And painful beyond measure  
Could love hurt so much?

Then he hit the bottom,  
He thought he knew where the bottom was  
He knew all along he would hit the bottom  
It was just a matter of time  
Then the storm started  
He was plunged again  
In strong currents  
This time he was unconscious with  
Hurt filling his lungs

He is washed on the shore  
The sand that was soft before  
is hard, unforgiving.  
Hurting even more.  
He slowly stands up,  
Weak and tired  
Finally out of love  
Wet still with the memories  
Of a sweet time  
Before the storm

He curses the sea,  
The ocean of love.  
He hates the beach  
And he hates himself  
For being so stupid  
To fall in love, knowing all well  
What will happen afterwards

He promises then  
Never to swim again  
Never again in the ocean of love  
And after promising himself  
He moves on to the next beach  
To repeat the same  
To swim again  
To curse again  
And to repeat the same
