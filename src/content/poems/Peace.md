For they say there is love in peace  
and forget the love for war.  
Far more want to kill than to love.  
Far more would love to kill someone,  
than love someone instead.  
They say that peace is joy,  
For they haven't seen the joy of men  
cutting each other, ending each other.  
The shine in their eyes, while the blades meet  
While the bullets whiz by,  
while ours' is being taken,  
we take the other's still.  
For there is love in war,  
as much, if not less, as peace.
