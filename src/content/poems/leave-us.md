We borrow time from our lives  
To meet each other,  
to be together.

The question isn't  
Whether the someone  
Will leave us?  
Because it will.  
Everyone leaves  
At one point or another.

The question is,  
When will the someone leave us?  
Six months from now?  
Or at 75, at its deathbed,  
With you by its side,  
When it leaves you,  
You will be the last thing it sees.

The question isn't whether someone will leave us?  
But when? Six months from now? Or at 75?
