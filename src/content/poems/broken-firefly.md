You would not believe your eyes  
If ten thousand fireflies  
Lit up the night skies  

But among those there are a few  
Those broken down  
Waiting for their impossible chance  
To steal the crown  

And those broken fireflies  
Those unheard tearful cries  
Those sleepless darkest nights  
They get shadowed by the lights  
Of other _perfect_ ten thousand fireflies  

They try to fly  
They dream to touch the sky  
But the wind is too strong  
And there's no right or wrong  

And then they fall  
Cause falling's easy  
But it only brings you down  

Only if someone could see  
Their unbearable insecurities  
Only if someone could feel  
Their broken shattered heart  
Only if they could realise  
They could always restart  

Only if you could know  
There is life beyond  
Those thick heavy books  
Those silly shabby looks
