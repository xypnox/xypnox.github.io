It's one of those days  
When a series of events  
Just pisses you off  
When the ink runs out  
When the eraser gets lost  
When you leave the key at the room  
And your cycle punctures  
It's one of those days  
When you are asked in class  
When you get the hardest experiment  
When you can't fall asleep  
And you have to wake up early  
It's one of those days
