I see myself in the mirror  
A broken face  
Swollen eyes and  
Messed up hair  
I do not know  
how I look to others.  
But I look ugly to me.

I see the sadness  
in other's eyes  
when they rest on me  
When they see the mess  
That I am  
That I always was  
And I always would be  

I wish with all the effort  
That I could have any other face  
Any other face in the world  
Just not mine. Please not mine.

A silent sob  
A lonely tear  
A broken face  
With swollen eyes

It's a face  
that can take  
a hundred more scars  
and still look the same

I wish I could have any other face  
And my wish is granted  
by some magical entity  
by some weird fantasy  
And I don't care  
Now I can have any face that I want  
Any face that I like

I go first for the face of  
celebrities  
of those who are universally  
beautiful  
And I look beautiful  
for the first time in my life  
I can see confidence  
in my eyes  
in _her_ eyes  
those eyes are not mine  
but I like those eyes  
more than mine

People notice  
People finally notice me  
Not because I am beautiful now  
But because I look like a celebrity  
literally.  
But they notice  
and that is what  
I really wanted all along

Slowly though I get bored of this face  
and then that face  
All the faces  
In all the world  
I feel now  
That I have lost myself  
I am never me  
Always someone else  
Someone else's face

And I wish now to get my face back  
And I forget what I looked like  
Cause I never looked at myself  
With admiration  
With approval  
With satisfaction

I can't change back to my face  
Because I have forgotten my face  
I am now like someone else  
Not me  
Not what I wanted to be  
All along.
