I heard you like poems  
So I wrote a few, just for you  
They aren't exactly new  
old words, repeated twice  
once again a several times  
your face, your hair, your eyes  
I wish they were mine  
I wish they were mine

When I'm with you, I forget about time   
I see that you see me too, together we rhyme.

I heard that you like poems  
So I wrote a few for you  
But they aren't as good as  
the ones others send you.
