"It's ok bro/sis, talk to me.  
I totally understand what you are going through!  
Things will work out.  
If you really love your parents ....  
Ending your life is not the answer.  
Plz dm me.  
You are just X years old.  
You don't have to do that!  
Life is not about ....  
I am here for you."

Who do you think you are? A therapist?  
Did you get a degree from somewhere?  
I didn't need a therapist.  
All I wanted was a friend.
