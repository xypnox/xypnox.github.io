Eyes talk to eyes,  
Likes understand like.  
Why do we expect  
The ear to know  
What the mouth says  
When the ear is not the mouth.  
Words are said,  
And words are heard.  
But feelings are seen  
From eyes, to eyes.  
Eyes talk to eyes,  
Words are small  
Contrived and confusing  
Whereas a few tears  
can say happiness and sadness  
So clearly  
As eyes talk to eyes,  
For the eyes have shed the tears  
And they have seen them too.  
When words are silent  
The loudest are your eyes.
